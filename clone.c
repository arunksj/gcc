/*I'd suggest people also take a look at the (beta) pthreads library that 
somebody wrote on top of clone() (the announcement is probably still in 
comp.os.linux.announce if you have a reasonable news spool). That is 
probably actually useful, unlike my minimal example.

	 *	%ecx - new stack pointer for cloned child

	 * into clone_flags: SIGCHLD makes the cloned process work like
	 * a "normal" unix child process)
	 *
	 * The clone() system call returns (in %eax) the pid of the newly
	 * cloned process to the parent, and 0 to the cloned process. If
	 * an error occurs, the return value will be the negative errno.
	 *
	 * In the child process, we will do a "jsr" to the requested function
	 * and then do a "exit()" system call which will terminate the child.
